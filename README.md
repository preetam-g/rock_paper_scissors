# Inspiration
Inspired by the famous "Rock_paper_scissors" hand game. This is a simulation done using Python OOPS. Random shapes are spawned over an area and start colliding with each other. During a collision, they change their direction of motion and shape based on the game's rules. Simulation is run until only two of three shapes remain on the screen.

# Implementation 
The main.py contains all the code required to run the simulation, and the shapes.py contains all the variables, functions for object creations, object descriptions, and methods. 

# How to run
Make sure you have all the files in the same directory, and then use the terminal in your code editor to change into the current directory. Then, type the "python main.py" command in the terminal to run the simulation.
