# Inspiration
Inspired from the famous "Rock_paper_scissors" hand game. This is a simulation done using OOPS in python language. Random shapes are spawned over an area and start colliding with each other. During a collision they change their direction of motion and also shape based on the game's rules. Simulation is run until there are only two of three shapes remain on the screen.

# Implementation 
The main.py contains all the code required to run the simulation and shapes.py contains all the vairables, functions for object creations, object descriptions and methods. 

# How to run
Make sure you have all the files same directory and then use terminal in vscode to change into current directory then use "python main.py" command to run the simulation.
